So here goes:
 Get a weighing machine Play some upper body sport, like basketball :)
 Weigh every week? Find out how to raise upper body strength Not to forget, push-ups. Drink milk. Sleep well. Finish 2 projects for e-doodle.  I wonder how to make this post sticky?</p>

        <p>There seems to be quite an explosion of demand in more powerful websites equipped with server capabilities using scripts like JavaScript, PHP, and Perl, having been involved with a couple of PHP companies.

        <p>EDUCATION IN MALAYSIA: Pak Lah Promises Scholarship for Top Students
Just a comment in Tony P&rsquo;s blog (on a small aspect of this story):
Beneath all this is the very question of the definition of a &ldquo;top student&rdquo;. It would seem that having all A1s would assure scholarships will fall your way.
