First, make sure that your www.domain.tld works as normal
Second, enable wildcard DNS by (various means, depending on your interface). But you should see something like
* 14400 A xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is your NS ip address (should be the same as the one in the www A record)</p>

        <p>ONCE upon a time, there was a small Kingdom in the South Seas. It was a peaceful place where many peoples of many different colours lived together.  By and large, they were happy. There was plenty to eat in this Kingdom and there were lots to do. Some of the people liked to dance, some liked to sing, some liked to tell stories. A few even did all three. And of course there were many who liked to watch those singing, dancing and telling stories.</p>

        <p>Wow, I accidentally hit F7 and Firefox turned into an annoying monster that has its own mind. Yes, press F7 and your up or down keyboard buttons behave differently when you are scrolling! It scrolls line by line, with a cursor (much like Word) instead of scrolling smoothly like a normal web page&hellip;.
Tip, it&rsquo;s called &lsquo;Caret Browsing&rsquo; &hellip;.So blo*** obscure</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve always hated the way Malaysian bloggers write about this concept of race: So, given that I accidentally have this treasure trove of data, I might as well perform some analysis on it.
Methodology: open up pdf file (Acrobat reader: and search (whole word only)
Limitations: Ignores context of the word being counted
Note: the pdf file refers to the &ldquo;surprise comments&rdquo; made on my blog, all about politics, which I will post it up when I find a file server to upload it to.</p>

        <p>I have any comments on my blog sent to my gmail.
This fine morning, I woke up and saw this bunch of comments! Imagine my surprise? Where did all this traffic come from&hellip;.
Then I realised the comments did not really make sense. They were talking about politics instead of about wises.co.nz. But they were from Malaysia and Australia and NZ. Blogger comment mixup?</p>

        <p>Is it the weather or something? I&rsquo;m not normally so pissed off (pardon the expression), but when did posting something become so difficult all of a sudden?
The ol&rsquo; Books and More down at Lambton Quay was a good friend of ours, with extended opening hours and nice staff, who helped YOU out.
My first step was greeted by this wall that stopped me from entering the Post shop from the streetside.</p>

        <p>Today, wises decided to give a ticket to hell. They gave a map and directions to nowhere! If you notice the picture, Broomhill Road is a dead end. (complete with fallen log, jungle track, non-tarred road, and being one-lane-so-turning-around-is-oh-so-hard). It doesn&rsquo;t lead to Highbury Road or Highbury Crescent or whatever.
Note to self: Mt Pleasant Rd is not so pleasant after all. How do those ppl live and drive there?</p>

        <p>Okay, Drupal works wonders&hellip;There u have it, the search is done :)
Sorry, forgot to put rambling warning on&hellip; ;)
Anyway, the cable car ride today was excellent. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve done that. When I graduate, I&rsquo;ll be sure to take a picture with Mr Sulky Graduate of 1990&hellip;&hellip;..And take my family along in the cable car ride&hellip;
I should really do this blogging thing properly&hellip;Now, couple of post to do, but always slips my mind&hellip;.</p>
