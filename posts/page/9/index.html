        <p>There seems to be quite an explosion of demand in more powerful websites equipped with server capabilities using scripts like JavaScript, PHP, and Perl, having been involved with a couple of PHP companies. However, I have always viewed this as &ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; languages, compared to Java or C++ which can be used for files and system programming as well. Of course, the lines are becoming blur as web languages introduce more &ldquo;heavyweight&rdquo; features like classes (e.</p>

        <p>EDUCATION IN MALAYSIA: Pak Lah Promises Scholarship for Top Students
Just a comment in Tony P&rsquo;s blog (on a small aspect of this story):
Beneath all this is the very question of the definition of a &ldquo;top student&rdquo;. It would seem that having all A1s would assure scholarships will fall your way. What I would like to point out is that scholarships should be allocated based on whether the applicant is able to succeed at university and further in their professional career(as well).</p>

        <p>Second upper, and unemployed Here unfortunately, is an example of misplaced priorities, at least from first glance. He has some good points but I feel that the worst mistake one can make(while studying) is to copy from another. You always lose as first, you gain nothing. Neither knowledge nor useful experience is gained. Second, you devalue your institution&rsquo;s and hence your cohort&rsquo;s degrees. Philosophically, it goes against the widely known economic theory of &lsquo;no free lunches&rsquo;.</p>

I went to the doctor yesterday about a sore on my lip. Turns out it was a cold sore. That first sentence from the doctor was okay. Next come a whole sermon about what cavemen ate hundreds of thousands of years ago. "Milk is bad. Grains, pooh pah." At this point I'm thinking err, then what does one eat?</p>

        <p>We have an online auction site, similar to eBay, which is called Trademe. It has been a roaring success since it&rsquo;s start sometime ago. However, recently, it was in the news as there is a so-called artist who has been kicked out of Trademe for copying directly from other people&rsquo;s photographs. You may ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with that?&rdquo; Well, you will have to know as well, that his paintings does not seem to real paintings(more printed) and his sceneries are from anywhere other than New Zealand(which he claims-he even states a specific spot).</p>
