Rationals might tackle problems in organic systems such as plants and animals, or in mechanical systems such as railroads and computers, or in social systems such as families and companies and governments. But whatever systems fire their curiosity, Rationals will analyze them to understand how they work, so they can figure out how to make them work better. <p>In working with problems, Rationals try to find solutions that have application in the real world, but they are even more interested in the abstract concepts involved, the fundamental principles or natural laws that underlie the particular case. And they are completely pragmatic about their ways and means of achieving their ends. Rationals don&rsquo;t care about being politically correct. They are interested in the most efficient solutions possible, and will listen to anyone who has something useful to teach them, while disregarding any authority or customary procedure that wastes time and resources. </p>  <p>Rationals have an insatiable hunger to accomplish their goals and will work tirelessly on any project they have set their mind to. They are rigorously logical and fiercely independent in their thinking&ndash;are indeed skeptical of all ideas, even their own&ndash;and they believe they can overcome any obstacle with their will power. Often they are seen as cold and distant, but this is really the absorbed concentration they give to whatever problem they&rsquo;re working on. Whether designing a skyscraper or an experiment, developing a theory or a prototype technology, building an aircraft, a corporation, or a strategic alliance, Rationals value intelligence, in themselves and others, and they pride themselves on the ingenuity they bring to their problem solving. </p>   <p>Rationals are very scarce, comprising as little as 5 to 10 percent of the population. But because of their drive to unlock the secrets of nature, and to develop new technologies, they have done much to shape our world.&rdquo;<br /></p> <p style="text-align: center; color: rgb(51, 102, 255);" id="fourtypes">The Four types of Rationals are:</p>         <p style="text-align: center;" id="thetypes">Architects (<abbr title="Introversion/Intuition/Thinking/Perception">INTP</abbr>) | Masterminds (<abbr title="Introversion/Intuition/Thinking/Judgement">INTJ</abbr>) | Inventors (<abbr title="Extroversion/Intuition/Thinking/Perception">ENTP</abbr>) | Field Marshals (<abbr title="Extroversion/Intuition/Thinking/Judgement">ENTJ</abbr>)<br />(from www.advisorteam.com)<br /></p> <div style="text-align: left;">So which one am I? Take a guess&hellip;.<br /><br />Being a rational fellow I know that I&rsquo;m introverted, so it&rsquo;s I(Architects or Mastermind). But is it P or J. <blockquote>   <p>                                  <b>Judging(J) Characteristics</b>                             </p>                 <ul> <li>                 <p>Plan many of the details in advance before moving into action.</p>               </li><li>                 <p>                Focus on task-related action; complete meaningful segments before moving on.</p>               </li><li>                 <p>                Work best and avoid stress when keep ahead of deadlines.</p>               </li><li>                 <p> Naturally use targets, dates and                        standard routines to manage life. </p>               </li>   </ul>                             <p>                                 <b>Perceiving(P) Characteristics</b>                             </p>                 <ul> <li>                 <p>              Comfortable moving into action without a plan; plan on-the-go.</p>               </li><li>                 <p> Like to multitask, have variety, mix work and play.</p>               </li><li>                 <p> Naturally tolerant of time pressure; work best close to the deadlines.</p>               </li><li>                 <p> Instinctively avoid commitments                    which interfere with flexibility, freedom and variety </p>               </li>   </ul> </blockquote>So therefore being the planner, I&rsquo;m the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mastermind </span>;)<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.raw.at/sub/galerie/images/comix/pinky_and_brain.gif"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://www.raw.at/sub/galerie/images/comix/pinky_and_brain.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /></div> <p style="text-align: left;" id="thetypes"></p><blockquote>   <p>&rdquo;&hellip;As the organizing capabilities the Masterminds increase so does their inclination to take charge of whatever is going on.   </p>   <p>&hellip;they are just like the others.
