        <p>Second upper, and unemployed Here unfortunately, is an example of misplaced priorities, at least from first glance. He has some good points but I feel that the worst mistake one can make(while studying) is to copy from another. You always lose as first, you gain nothing. Neither knowledge nor useful experience is gained. Second, you devalue your institution&rsquo;s and hence your cohort&rsquo;s degrees. Philosophically, it goes against the widely known economic theory of &lsquo;no free lunches&rsquo;.</p>

I went to the doctor yesterday about a sore on my lip. Turns out it was a cold sore. That first sentence from the doctor was okay. Next come a whole sermon about what cavemen ate hundreds of thousands of years ago. "Milk is bad. Grains, pooh pah." At this point I'm thinking err, then what does one eat?</p>

        <p>We have an online auction site, similar to eBay, which is called Trademe. It has been a roaring success since it&rsquo;s start sometime ago. However, recently, it was in the news as there is a so-called artist who has been kicked out of Trademe for copying directly from other people&rsquo;s photographs. You may ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with that?&rdquo; Well, you will have to know as well, that his paintings does not seem to real paintings(more printed) and his sceneries are from anywhere other than New Zealand(which he claims-he even states a specific spot).</p>

        <p>Jail for poor NS dodger who could not pay fine
Looks like the Government, instead of making an example of dodgers, has made a very good example of itself, instead. This serves to highlight how the programme has been fraught with problems, from transportation problems, security and of course, rushing the bill through Parliament. We need to have a credible opposition. Where is it?
Good for the Perlis Umno Youth to offer to help pay the fine.</p>

        <p>That&rsquo;s all of my assignments all done. Now to start blogging. :)
First thing to do is to hit self on head for not discovering the new features of JAVA 1.5 [new window] earlier! {whack}. A friend just mentioned that foreach is now implemented in Java. Imagine how simple would that be:
foreach (Bean in Sack) do somethinginstead of
for(bean =1; bean &lt;= beans in sack; next bean)
As well as generics(from C/C++), which is a very powerful feature.</p>
