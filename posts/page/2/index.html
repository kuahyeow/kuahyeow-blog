This is why you need to identify and nurture Your People.&rdquo; What are Your People? &ldquo;You tell these stories to Your People without reservation. Your People love your stories — fiction and all. They love how you tell them, they laugh about the lies you tell yourself, and then they stop and they tell you the truth.&rdquo; You need someone to keep you honest.</p>

        <p>StrengthsFinder is an amazing book, and an assessment tool that helps you discover your strengths. Its central concept is that you should focus on your strengths, not your weaknesses. I was introduced to it at the Summer of Code (NZ) program several years ago. The concept of focusing on strengths was just brilliant. This really reminded me of my game playing style, especially in RPGs, where you have to increase the levels and skills of your character(s) in order to be able to fight enemies that pop up with increasing difficulty and toughness.</p>

        <p>ActiveRecord::Base#find_each is an awesome idiom for batch processing large sets of data. It combines the neat DSL of ActiveRecord and allows you to operate at the level of the individual item. So, imagine my surprise when I debugged my code and discovered that find_each introduces a scope into ActiveRecord calls within the block. Demonstrating by example: Slam.find_each(:conditions =&gt; {:value =&gt; nil}) do |slam|#&hellip;.&nbsp; Slam.find_by_key(slam.key) #Find related key&nbsp; #However, in effect becomes Slam.find_by_key(:key =&gt; slam.key, :value =&gt; nil)end Looking at the SQL in the logs, I expected to see: select * from slams where key = &lsquo;abcde&rsquo;; Instead I saw: select * from slams where key = &lsquo;abcde&rsquo; and value is null; It took me fifteen minutes to check and verify there is no code that should be generating that SQL, so the next candidate was find_each.</p>

        <p>Someone always asks this question -&nbsp; how do you check types in Ruby? (*Hint: Ruby use dynamic typing) This typical newbie question would ask this and be answered with various levels of helpfulness - typically none - sadly. However this thread is just beautiful in its helpfulness. http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/msg/eb4b49a511e44be6?hl=en What happended snarkiness, or Slashdot / Youtube style comments? All this helpfulness must come from somewhere. I blame Twitter.</p>

        <p>Hacking for the greater good : the good being helping to free up important government information. A Barcamp and Hackfest was held just this weekend, in the last days of August. I participated in the Hackfest, which was held at the amazing Southern Cross Bar. Great food and nice private room made for a good environment for coding. The Hackfest was a bit more structured than previous events I have been to, but I&rsquo;ll say this had a positive effect of helping people choose what and who they wanted to work with.</p>

        <p>Update: I have found a nicer way of doing autocomplete. Basically, use the string type with the &ldquo;starting_with&rdquo;&nbsp;method.&nbsp;See this ticket comment. Solr is really nice search engine which has the added advantage of being able to return items that you put into the search engine, unlike say, sphinx (which is really fast but only returns the document id). However, Solr is very complex. Thankfully, there is a very neat ruby abstraction for Solr, called Sunspot.</p>

        <p>Let&rsquo;s start simple. Here is a situation I have encountered more than once. We have this big long class or method, and embedded in it are several blocks of code, all commented out. def some_method(a) do_something(a) calc_another # wow # do_do # calc_calc # zcalc(z) end What should I do? Given the code is version controlled, I would happily throw it away. The code is commented out and will have no effect whatsoever on any program or user.</p>

        <p>Consider this question from Riding Rails: Community Highlights: IronRuby (emphasis mine). Matt: Are there any limitations that our readers should be aware of before starting to develop on IronRuby? Jimmy: The main limitation is that IronRuby does not support any of the C-based Ruby libraries, and only after 1.0 will we consider building an interop layer between the Ruby C API and IronRuby. In the meantime, people have been porting their favorite C-based Ruby libraries over to C# so it can be used from IronRuby, like Hpricot.</p>
