        <p>If like me, after a long week at work, you find yourself typing in a ubuntu terminal: sudo chown mail /[I&rsquo;ll explain why later] Then you are in for a whole heap of trouble, because, inexplicably, sudo now does not work, instead, it complains about /var/run/sudo not owned by uid 0 (root), but by uid 8, which I presume to be the user mail. By the way, all contents of folder &lsquo;var&rsquo; is now under the dominion of the unholy &lsquo;mail&rsquo; user.</p>

        <p>Using CPanel, WHM, shell Access (or plesk), DNS Prerequisites: Shell Access (or ability to edit the httpd.conf)DNS editing accessWildcard DNS abilityPHP!* We use www.domain.tld as an example. Modify to suit. First, make sure that your www.domain.tld works as normal Second, enable wildcard DNS by (various means, depending on your interface). But you should see something like * 14400 A xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is your NS ip address (should be the same as the one in the www A record) Third, change/add the ServerAlias directive in your httpd.conf file to something like ServerAlias *.domain.tld You should see now that all addresses, *.domain.tld will be redirected internally to www.domain.tld Last, use Php&rsquo;s $HTTP_HOST command and explode and you&rsquo;re done!</p>

        <p>ONCE upon a time, there was a small Kingdom in the South Seas. It was a peaceful place where many peoples of many different colours lived together. By and large, they were happy. There was plenty to eat in this Kingdom and there were lots to do. Some of the people liked to dance, some liked to sing, some liked to tell stories. A few even did all three. And of course there were many who liked to watch those singing, dancing and telling stories.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve always hated the way Malaysian bloggers write about this concept of race: So, given that I accidentally have this treasure trove of data, I might as well perform some analysis on it. Methodology: open up pdf file (Acrobat reader: and search (whole word only) Limitations: Ignores context of the word being counted Note: the pdf file refers to the &ldquo;surprise comments&rdquo; made on my blog, all about politics, which I will post it up when I find a file server to upload it to.</p>

Then I realised the comments did not really make sense. They were talking about politics instead of about wises.co.nz. But they were from Malaysia and Australia and NZ. Blogger comment mixup?</p>
