        <p>Okay, Drupal works wonders&hellip;There u have it, the search is done :)
Sorry, forgot to put rambling warning on&hellip; ;)
Anyway, the cable car ride today was excellent. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve done that. When I graduate, I&rsquo;ll be sure to take a picture with Mr Sulky Graduate of 1990&hellip;&hellip;..And take my family along in the cable car ride&hellip;
I should really do this blogging thing properly&hellip;Now, couple of post to do, but always slips my mind&hellip;.</p>

        <p>Warning: This is going to be a rambling post.
So, today we had another Drupal session where we tied up loose ends that we have started with profile search thing. Turns out that creating a search form is not that hard. All we need is just two additional functions, one to create the search form; and the other to display the results.
Did I tell u that Drupal is great! The search form is not the only way we can do this though.</p>

        <p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all!!
I guess it&rsquo;s time to start planning for a new 2006 year. (Aside: Anyone besides me still wondering how the hell humanity managed to get back the year 2000? I mean, we are in 2006! 6 years after and I still can&rsquo;t get my head around the weirdness of a &lsquo;2&rsquo; in front of years&hellip;.There must be a word for this)
But first, some updates on what happended this Christmas.</p>

        <p>Second update: My dearest has received it! I must say, this episode has resolved itself at last, after some really unnessecary nonsensical customer service from the folks at teddybearland.com.
Update: I have just received an email from the sales staff apologising for missing my order! I replied back and now it&rsquo;s back to &lsquo;ghost mode&rsquo; again (meaning, no reply!)

        <p>&ldquo;Rationals, are the problem solving temperament, particularly if the problem has to do with the many complex systems that make up the world around us. Rationals might tackle problems in organic systems such as plants and animals, or in mechanical systems such as railroads and computers, or in social systems such as families and companies and governments. But whatever systems fire their curiosity, Rationals will analyze them to understand how they work, so they can figure out how to make them work better.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, writing things down will make things happen. (As long as you refer back and remember ;)
So here goes:
 Get a weighing machine Play some upper body sport, like basketball :)
 Weigh every week? Find out how to raise upper body strength Not to forget, push-ups. Drink milk. Sleep well. Finish 2 projects for e-doodle.  I wonder how to make this post sticky?</p>

        <p>The Darth Side: Memoirs of a Monster Can you believe this? Althought his nick is cheesy, his writing is just superb. I quote: &rdquo;&hellip;And yet, there is my son with Shmi in his eyes &ndash; a product of love, before the storm. He is no Jedi, for his passion blows too hot, but perhaps he is not Sith, either. He is an instrument of change. He is the catalyst at the centre, the fulcrum on which pivot fates.</p>

        <p>Ok, I&rsquo;ll try to squeeze as much out as I can within a couple of minutes, seeing that I&rsquo;m out of time for work and study and assignments and rest.
First, Blackie died. Dropsy. Thought it was a tumour which shrunk, and then poof, &hellip;
There has been plenty of worthy current events worth mentioning, but I don&rsquo;t have the rigour to carry out a rational analysis. I&rsquo;ll be content reading what bloggers and reporters have to say about this.</p>
