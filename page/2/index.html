The first thing that jarred me was that my full birthday is published. This in combination with search engine visibility means that it&rsquo;s spammer time.
Next thing that happened is that the privacy settings had &ldquo;Everyone&rdquo;, &ldquo;Friends of Friends&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Friends&rdquo;. Nice and simple, I thought. But no, I have to exclude my full birthday again from everyone. (I know about how your friend&rsquo;s applications can just mine everyone&rsquo;s data through friends).</p>

        <p>I have a problem where a project is using an older version of RSpec (currently the lastest version is RSpec 1.3.0). Therefore running
spec spec/model/some_model_spec.rbgives me an error
/spec/models/../spec_helper.rb:23: undefined method `use_transactional_fixtures=&rsquo;The solution would be to use the older, vendored spec. Now, the spec binary that is installed as part of the gem installation should do this (some gems do checked for vendor&rsquo;ed binaries) and my rspec is installed under vendor/plugins, not vendor/gems.</p>

Really good insight - &ldquo;As we edit our days into these stories, there is always a risk of fiction. This is why you need to identify and nurture Your People.&rdquo;
What are Your People? &ldquo;You tell these stories to Your People without reservation. Your People love your stories â€” fiction and all. They love how you tell them, they laugh about the lies you tell yourself, and then they stop and they tell you the truth.</p>

        <p>StrengthsFinder is an amazing book, and an assessment tool that helps you discover your strengths. Its central concept is that you should focus on your strengths, not your weaknesses. I was introduced to it at the Summer of Code (NZ) program several years ago. The concept of focusing on strengths was just brilliant. This really reminded me of my game playing style, especially in RPGs, where you have to increase the levels and skills of your character(s) in order to be able to fight enemies that pop up with increasing difficulty and toughness.</p>
